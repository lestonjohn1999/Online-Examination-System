# Online-Examination-System
I carried out my internship in Quality Theorem from December of 2019 to January of 2020 under the supervision of our team lead Mr. Krishna Mohan. Quality Theorem as a company deals with IoT products and many other software services to the smart citiesâ€™ initiative of India. 

 

I worked on one out of their many projects named Online Examination System which was intended to be used as one of the services in their offerings to the smart city projects and also as a medium to conduct interviews for future employees of the company. 

 

I got to experience the full software development life cycle from requirement gathering to product testing and delivery. It was an onsite internship with regular office hours and I was the team member of one of the 5 teams working on this project.
